# Uber_Travel_Times

Analyze the zone-to-zone travel times recorded for Uber journeys in London. 

The data have been retrieved by using the following API: https://movement.uber.com/?lang=en-GB, which we can use to download data that includes the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and standard deviations for aggregated travel times over the selected date-range between every zone pair in London. 

In the first version of the project, which is mostly exploratory, we will use only the aggregated data for 2020 Quarter 1.
